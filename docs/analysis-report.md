## 2. Complexity Analysis

### 2.1 Time Complexity Derivation

#### 2.1.1 Mathematical Formulation
**Comparison Operations:**



**Swap Operations:**
S(n) = Σ_{i=0}^{n-2} I_{min_index ≠ i}
≤ n-1 ∈ O(n)


#### 2.1.2 Best Case Analysis: Ω(n²)
**Scenario:** Pre-sorted array with early termination check  
**Comparisons:** n(n-1)/2 (early check adds n-1 comparisons)  
**Swaps:** 0 (no elements require repositioning)  
**Mathematical Justification:**

lim_{n→∞} [n(n-1)/2] / n² = 1/2 ⇒ Ω(n²)

#### 2.1.3 Worst Case Analysis: O(n²)
**Scenario:** Reverse-sorted array  
**Comparisons:** n(n-1)/2  
**Swaps:** n-1 (every element requires movement)  
**Upper Bound Proof:**
C(n) = n(n-1)/2 ≤ n² for n ≥ 1 ⇒ O(n²)


#### 2.1.4 Average Case Analysis: Θ(n²)
**Expected Value Analysis:**
E[Comparisons] = n(n-1)/2 (deterministic)
E[Swaps] = Σ_{i=0}^{n-2} P(element i not in position)
≈ Σ_{i=0}^{n-2} (1 - 1/(n-i)) ≈ n - H_n ∈ Θ(n)


**Final Complexity:** Θ(n²) dominated by comparison operations

### 2.2 Space Complexity Analysis
- **Auxiliary Space:** O(1) - constant extra space
- **In-place Operation:** Array modified without additional storage
- **Memory Components:**
    - Loop counters: O(1)
    - Temporary variables: O(1)
    - Recursion: None (iterative implementation)

### 2.3 Recurrence Relation Solution
**Recurrence Formulation:**
T(n) = T(n-1) + (n-1) + c
= [T(n-2) + (n-2) + c] + (n-1) + c
= T(n-3) + (n-3) + (n-2) + (n-1) + 3c

**Closed-form Solution:**
T(n) = T(1) + Σ_{i=1}^{n-1} i + (n-1)c
= 1 + n(n-1)/2 + (n-1)c
∈ Θ(n²)


### 2.4 Comparative Analysis with Insertion Sort
| Complexity Aspect | Selection Sort | Insertion Sort |
|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Time Best Case** | Θ(n²) | Θ(n) |
| **Time Worst Case** | Θ(n²) | Θ(n²) |
| **Time Average Case** | Θ(n²) | Θ(n²) |
| **Space Complexity** | O(1) | O(1) |
| **Adaptive** | No | Yes |
| **Stable** | No | Yes |

    private long swaps;
    private long assignments;
    
    // Positive: Clear separation of concerns
    // Positive: Comprehensive metric tracking
    // Positive: Input validation implemented
}

3.2 Optimization Opportunities

3.2.1 Algorithmic Improvements

1. Bidirectional Selection Sort:

private void bidirectionalSelectionSort(int[] array) {
    int left = 0, right = array.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int minIndex = left, maxIndex = right;
        
        // Single pass for both min and max
        for (int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            comparisons += 2;
            if (array[i] < array[minIndex]) minIndex = i;
            if (array[i] > array[maxIndex]) maxIndex = i;
        }
        
        swap(array, left, minIndex);
        if (maxIndex == left) maxIndex = minIndex;
        swap(array, right, maxIndex);
        
        left++; right--;
    }
}

2. Enhanced Early Termination:
private boolean isAlreadySorted(int[] array) {
    for (int i = 1; i < array.length; i++) {
        if (array[i] < array[i - 1]) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

3.2.2 Code Quality Improvements

private int findMinIndex(int[] array, int start) {
    int minIndex = start;
    for (int j = start + 1; j < array.length; j++) {
        comparisons++;
        if (array[j] < array[minIndex]) {
            minIndex = j;
        }
    }
    return minIndex;
}
